Previously it had a class A pre-amplifier stage but I decided to remove it and let the op-amp handle the voltage and current amplification stages.\r\n\r\n![Amplifier](http://i.imgur.com/ooLOsXO.png)\r\n\r\nThe power supply is very simple since it's supposed to be powered by 6x18650 cells or 2x9V batteries.\r\n\r\n![Power Supply](http://i.imgur.com/1NUn6F1.png)\r\n\r\nThis amplifier also includes a clipping/overload detector:\r\n\r\n![Clipping/Overload Detector](http://i.imgur.com/JDpisI1.png)","google":"UA-37990129-7","note":"Don't delete this file!
